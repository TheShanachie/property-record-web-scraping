# ConfigUtils Directory

## Overview
The `ConfigUtils` directory is responsible for managing configuration-related utilities for the project. It provides tools to handle configuration files, parse settings, and manage application-level configurations. This directory plays a critical role in ensuring that the application can be easily configured and adapted to different environments or use cases.

## Directory Structure
The `ConfigUtils` directory contains the following files and subdirectories:

---

## File Descriptions

### 1. `__init__.py`
- **Purpose**: Marks the `ConfigUtils` directory as a Python package, allowing its modules to be imported elsewhere in the project.
- **Details**: This file is typically empty or contains package-level imports.

---

### 2. `Config.py`
- **Purpose**: Contains the core logic for managing and parsing configuration files.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads configuration settings from the `config.yaml` file.
  - Provides utility functions to access configuration values.
  - Ensures that default values are used if certain settings are missing.
- **Use Case**: This file is used to load and manage application settings dynamically, making it easier to adapt the application to different environments.

---

### 3. `config.yaml`
- **Purpose**: A YAML file that stores application configuration settings in a structured format.
- **Key Features**:
  - Contains key-value pairs for various configuration options.
  - Can be easily edited to update settings without modifying the code.
- **Use Case**: Acts as the central configuration file for the application. Developers and administrators can modify this file to change application behavior.

---

### 4. `__pycache__/`
- **Purpose**: Stores compiled Python files (`.pyc`) for performance optimization.
- **Details**: This directory is automatically generated by Python and does not require manual modification.

---

### 5. `docs/`
- **Purpose**: Contains documentation related to the `ConfigUtils` module.
- **Details**:
  - May include markdown files, diagrams, or other resources explaining how to use the `ConfigUtils` module.
  - Helps developers understand the purpose and usage of the configuration utilities.

## Deliverables
The `ConfigUtils` directory provides the following deliverables:
1. **Dynamic Configuration Management**: The `Config.py` module allows the application to dynamically load and manage configuration settings.
2. **Centralized Configuration File**: The `config.yaml` file acts as a single source of truth for application settings.
3. **Documentation**: The `docs/` folder provides resources to help developers understand and use the configuration utilities effectively.

## Use Cases
1. **Environment-Specific Settings**:
   - Use the `config.yaml` file to define settings for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).
   - Example: Specify database connection strings, API keys, or logging levels.

2. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Modify the `config.yaml` file to update application behavior without changing the code.
   - Example: Enable or disable debugging by toggling a flag in the configuration file.

3. **Centralized Configuration Management**:
   - Use the `Config.py` module to access configuration values from anywhere in the application.
   - Example: Retrieve the logging level or database credentials dynamically.
