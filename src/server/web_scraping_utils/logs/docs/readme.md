# Logs Directory

## Overview
The `Logs` directory is responsible for storing log files generated by the application during its execution. These log files capture important information about the application's behavior, including events, errors, warnings, and debugging details. The logs are essential for monitoring the application's performance, diagnosing issues, and maintaining a record of operations for auditing purposes.

This directory works in conjunction with the `LoggingUtils` module, which provides the logging utilities (`WebScrapeLogger` and `RecordLogger`) used to generate and manage these logs.
