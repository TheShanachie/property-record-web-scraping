# Universal Path Resolution

## Main Goals
1. **All imports resolve correctly** - Module imports work in development and packaged environments
2. **Paths resolve correctly from any working directory** - File/data paths work regardless of CWD
3. **Unified behavior across environments** - Same logic works in development and packaged modes

## Implementation Goal
Fix `get_package_root()` to use file location calculation instead of imports, ensuring uniform path resolution for runtime files (configs, binaries, logs) across all environments.

## Tasks

- [x] Fix get_package_root() to use file location calculation
- [x] Verify path resolution uses package root consistently  
- [x] Test imports work correctly in both environments
- [x] Test file paths resolve correctly from any CWD
- [x] Test development mode (src/ structure)
- [x] Test packaged mode (site-packages/ structure)

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix get_package_root() to use file location calculation
- Use `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent` instead of complex calculations
- Config.py is always at: property_record_web_scraping/server/config_utils/Config.py
- Go up 3 levels to get package root: config_utils -> server -> property_record_web_scraping

### 2. Verify path resolution uses package root consistently
- Ensure resolve_path() method uses package root for all relative paths
- Confirm YAML config paths resolve from package root
- Check that build directories use package root

### 3. Test imports work correctly in both environments
- Verify absolute imports (property_record_web_scraping.server.*) work
- Ensure no circular import issues
- Confirm no import-time side effects

### 4. Test file paths resolve correctly from any CWD
- Run tests from project root, subdirectories, and external directories
- Verify Chrome binaries, config files, and logs are found correctly
- Ensure paths work regardless of current working directory

### 5. Test development mode (src/ structure)
- Verify paths resolve correctly when running from development environment
- Confirm build binaries and config files are accessible

### 6. Test packaged mode (site-packages/ structure)
- Test with actual pip install to site-packages
- Verify paths resolve correctly in installed package environment
- Ensure no extra path segments or missing directories
